This project was designed for online booking and buying tickets for cinema.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites	

To create this project I used Python, Django, DRF, PostgresSQL

### Installing

Well, at the beginning you need to clone my repositories and insert it in "Version Control" in Pycharm, then you need to create venv "python -m venv venv", then install all requirements "pip install -r requirements.txt", then you need to make migrations
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

And after all the guides you need to create superuser "Python manage.py createsuperuser" and after creating, you just need to start the project "Python manage.py runserver".
